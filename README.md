Project Machine Learning WS23/24: [SchNet: A continuous-filter convolutional neural
network for modeling quantum interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.08566.pdf)

This is a repository covering the code and reports for the module "Project Machine Learning" at TU Berlin. We attempted to reproduce the paper and expand on it by introducing the following:

1. Two different confidence measures for the model predictions, using ensemble models and statistical inference
2. Exploration of the hyperparameter space, revealing better suited hyperparameters
3. Explainability measure for model predictions
4. Regularization, namely [RMSNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467)
5. A prototype SchNet Transformer architecture
